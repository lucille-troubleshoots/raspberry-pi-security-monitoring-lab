# Raspberry Pi Security Monitoring Lab

A hands-on security monitoring lab built on a **Raspberry Pi 4** to practice log analysis, alert triage, and basic incident response workflows.

This project focuses on understanding *how alerts are generated, investigated, and documented*, rather than just installing tools.

## Overview

This repository documents a personal homelab designed to simulate **entry‑level security monitoring and troubleshooting workflows** using a lightweight Linux environment.

The goal is to build familiarity with:

* System and authentication events
* Alert review and basic triage
* Clear, repeatable documentation of findings

---

## Objectives

* Monitor system and authentication activity
* Practice reviewing and triaging security alerts
* Document investigation and response steps
* Build comfort working from the command line in a Linux environment

## Why this project

This lab is part of my hands‑on learning as an **IT Support Specialist** building deeper experience with system monitoring, troubleshooting, and security fundamentals. It reflects how I approach problems in real environments: understand the issue, investigate carefully, and document what was learned.
